# üìä Statistics Advanced - 1 Assignment (DA-AG-006)

This repository contains the solutions for the assignment **DA-AG-006: Statistics Advanced - 1**, submitted as part of the Data Analytics program offered by PhysicsWallah.

## üìÅ Assignment Details

in this assignment includes both theoretical and Python-based components. The goal is to apply statistical concepts in real-world scenarios using Python.

### üìå Assignment Questions:

1. **What is a random variable in probability theory?**

2. **What are the types of random variables?**

3. **Explain the difference between discrete and continuous distributions.**

4. **What is a binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?**

5. **What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?**

6. **What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?**

7. **What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?**

8. **What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?**

9. **Write a Python program to generate 1000 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean = 50 and standard deviation = 5. Compute its mean and standard deviation using NumPy, and draw a histogram to visualize the distribution. (Include your Python code and output)**

10. **You are working as a data analyst for a retail company. The company has collected daily sales data for 2 years and wants you to identify the overall sales trend.**

    ```python
    daily_sales = [220, 245, 210, 265, 230, 250, 260, 275, 240, 255,
                   235, 260, 245, 250, 225, 270, 265, 255, 250, 260]
    ```
    - Explain how you would apply the Central Limit Theorem to estimate the average sales with a 95% confidence interval.
    - Write the Python code to compute the mean sales and its confidence interval.
